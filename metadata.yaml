description: "A Counterfeit Presentment is a play written by American author and playwright\
  \ William Dean Howells in 1877. The play is a realistic comedy and tells the story\
  \ of a chance encounter between a young woman, Constance, and a man whom she mistakes\
  \ for her ex lover, Bartlett. However, Bartlett is not completely aware of Constance's\
  \ neurotic behavior until he gets to know her a bit more. Her true personality is\
  \ only truly expressed after she forces Bartlett to stay with her in the hotel so\
  \ she can pretend he is her former beau. Howellâ€™s uses comedy to reveal the deeper\
  \ issue of the plight of unmarried middle and upper class women in the 19th century.\n\
